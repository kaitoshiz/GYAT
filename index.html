        skibidi toilet <b>SIGMA !!! </b> 

        <p>
            The series depicts a conflict between singing human-headed toilets—the titular "Skibidi Toilets"—and humanoids with CCTV cameras, speakers, and televisions in place of their heads. The Skibidi Toilets, led by "G-Toilet", overtake humanity. Warfare soon develops between the toilets and the alliance of Cameramen and Speakermen. Each kind of the alliance has a colossal version of themselves, termed "Titans". The Titan Speakerman is infected with a mind-control parasite developed by the toilets' second-in-command and chief strategist, "Scientist Toilet", causing the Titan Speakerman to turn on the alliance. The alliance is expanded to include a species of TV-headed humanoids, and, with their help, Titan Speakerman is eventually cured.
